        <p class="text-muted">I don't know what to write in this section cuz for starters I don't even know if there IS a church in our school. The teachers do make us say prayers in the morning before boring us to death. To me those prayers feel more like a will that people leave when they die. Just that I don't have anything to leave behind. Still back to track. This once when I was auditioning for choir the teachers asked me to wait and sent me to a room. The room was filled with pictures of jeasus and all. So I think that the room is for the prayers. You see the reason I was in the dark about this room is because IT WAS FOR BODERS (children who stay at school) ONLY! Now that wasn't a shock to me. </p>

        <p class="text-muted">Now this is something that I know is in our school. Guess why, CUZ I'VE BEEN THERE. The library has a lot of books, INTRESTING BOOKS. I have read many, if there was an award for most read boks, I'd surely get it. Classes from 3rd to 12th go to the library. But I pity the classes from 3rd to 5th cuz they don't have any right in choosing the book they want to read. They can only PRAY that they get something NICE. And trust me it doesn't feel good when the book you wanted goes in the hand of the person sitting right NEXT to you.  </p>
